Solution:-

      Integre:- 1) -87.8
                2) 6

      String:-  1) 'hello'
Mathematical Operator:- * , - , / , +

Que:-2

Solution:-

      Variable is the name given to a memory location in a program and it is used to store the value and string is a                   sequence of characters or also define as a series of characters.

      example of varibale:- a = 5 here "a" is work as a container and a = 5 become variable.
      example of String:- 1) 'ineuron' it is string.
                          2) 'data engineer' it is also string.
Que:-3

Solution:- Data type are the classification of data items.

       Three different data type are:-

       1) Numeric Type

          In numeric there are integer,Complex number and float.

          examples:- Integer define as just a number like 2, 60, 100.
                     complex number is combination of real and imaginary part, like 45+3j ,where 45 is a real part and 3j is                          imaginary part of complex number.
                     float is like 34.5 ,like this we define the floating number.
       2) Sequence Type

          In sequence type there are list, tuple.

          example:-  list define as a container to store a set of values of any data type.
                     like,  list = ["cars" , " bus" , 7  ] 

                     tuple is another data type in python and tuple cannot be manipulated once it is define.
                     like,  tuple = (1,5,6) 

       3) Set Type

          In set data type it is used to store multiple items in a one single variable and set data type is        unodered,unindexed,unchangeable.But we can add items by doing some python operation on particular set which we defined during  the operation.

          example:- set = {"mobile" , "television"}
                    # To add one item in set:

                    set.add("cycle")
                    print(set)
                    output:-{"cycle", "mobile", "television"}
Que:-4

Solution:-

     An expression in python represent the sequence of string,tuple,list,set and expression is sequence that evaluates to a          value.

     like,  a = expression  , so expression always leads in right-hand side of an assinment or called as container.
Que:-5

Solution:-

     Statement defined as,  it perform some action or task when it is define in programme or statement is a line of code              that will not print any value on the screen  and expression evaluate to a value during the operation or programme.

     example:- 

              a = 10   (#it is a statment )
              b = a + 2   (#it is an expression)
              print(b) 

              output:-   12
Que:-6

Solution:-

       baccon = 22
       print(bacon+1)

       output:- 23   (# it is an integer type) 
Que:-7

Solution:-

       1) 'spam' + 'spamspam'

        output:- spamspamspam

       2) 'spam'*3

        output:- spamspamspam
Que:-8

Solution:-

       eggs is a valid variable name instead of 100 because as per the certain rules for python variable like variable name
       can only starts with underscore,alphabets,letters.

       example:- eggs = "spam"
                 print(eggs) 
                 output:- spam

                 so above example valid for assign a variable name eggs.

       example:- 100 = "spam"
                 print(100)
                 output:- error

       example:- eggs_100 = "spam"
                 print(eggs_100)
                 output:- spam

                 so the variable name eggs_100 is valid as per the python varibale rule so that's is the reason it will run                      and excute our code properly.
Que:-9

Solution:-

      The three functions are int(),str(),and float().

      There are many functions to convert one data type to other.

      example:- str(35) = "35"  (# integer to string conversion)
                int("35") = 35  (# string to integer conversion)
                float(35) = 35.0 (# integer to float conversion)
Que:-10

Solution:-

      Given expression is 'i have eaten'+ 99 + 'burritos'
      if we run the above expression we get a typeerror and it says that can only concatenate string to string not integer
      so for solving this typeerror we first convert integer to string then only we excute the expression successfully.

      a = 'i have eaten' + ' 99 ' + 'burritos'  (# here we create complete string)
      print(a)
      output:- i have eaten 99 burritos
